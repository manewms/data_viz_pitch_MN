# Who Owns Weed?

According to the ACLU, marijuana related arrests account for over half of all drug arrests. Black people are 4-8 times more likely to be arrested for it than white people, depending on what state you’re in. Now that it’s legalized, some view the cost of keeping these offenders incarcerated to be a waste and disproportionately harming people of color, specifically, black people. 

I want to find a way to visualize this inequality and compare it to tax payer money used to perpetuate it. 

I’d like to use data from the ACLU, the Office of Justice Programs - Bureau of Justice Statistics - Crime and Drug Facts as well as the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation.

- How have these numbers changed since states began legalizing?
- What are the potential impacts of federal pushback?
Who is profiting from marijuana legalization? 
- Who is hurting the most?
- Who owns the legal weed business in the U.S. and what are their other business interests?

I’d like to use a heat Map to show arrests per million across the US, use color to indicate which of those arrests led to incarceration per race.

I’d also like to incorporate a visual from the prison populations a century ago and their demographic make-up to prisons of today and compare them to other forms of marginalization of people of color. 

I’d like guidance on how to best visualize the path from marijuana arrest to incarceration to recidivism rate and success of for-profit prisons. 

While charts and graphs exist on the topic, I’d like to focus on creating a current and comprehensive interactive data visualization.
